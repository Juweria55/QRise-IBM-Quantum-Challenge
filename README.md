Dynamic Circuits: Maximizing performance and tailoring Noise



Dynamic circuits are an exciting feature of IBM Quantum hardware that incorporates quantum circuits with real-time classical communication. Different from the static counterpart, dynamic circuits can not only implement a set of basic quantum operations like the Hardmard gate, CNOT gate, or qubit reset but also can implement measurement in the middle of a circuit, store the measurement results to classical bits, evaluate classical expressions on the fly, and determine what quantum operation to do next. This capability has a variety of applications, for example, quantum error correction, quantum simulation, and so on. 

In this challenge, you will explore can do with dynamic circuits. Bonus point if you show improvement of your dynamic circuit implementation over its static counterpart - for example, use dynamic circuit feature to shorten the circuit depth, suppress error rate, and so on.
